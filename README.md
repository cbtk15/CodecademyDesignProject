# Codecademy Design System Project

This is a design system template, it started off as a project for Codecademy which asked us to create a design system website mock up with some fonts, colors and components.
After I completed the project, I've tried to expand the project to make the site reponsive for mobile. This is the unconventional way of doing things, as usually you would start with the mobile styles first. 
This lead me into some hickups with the design. However, after getting feedback from users, I was able to add some adjustments. 

I still have some adjustments to be made, the styling for the hamburger nav list is really bad at the momment, so when I get the time, I shall improve the styles for that. 


## Special Features include:

- Background color animation for larger viewports so that it is meant to lead the eyes from the title to the contents navigation upon loading the page,
- Internal links to the different sections of the design system,
- Back to the top icon on the bottom right hand side of the viewport for large screens and a back to the top button for mobiles on the bottom of the viewport,
- Navigation for inside each section for large to tablet size viewports,
- Hamburger Menu for mobile sized viewports which appears after you go past the main navigation and becomes more visable when upon scrolling up.



Any feedback would be appreciated and thankyou for stopping by. 

God bless 
Will
